For this assignment we were given a base project to work from that was written by our lecturer. I have not included and of these files as it was not my work.
The key goal of this assignment was to produce a number of different pixel and vertex shaders to produce different effects on objects in the scene.
These effects were: normal mapping, parallax mapping, linear interpolation, cell shading, vertex manipulation, alpha additive and multiplicative blending.
The project also implements three different forms of lighting, point lights, directional lights and ambient lighting.

If available, a link to a video demonstrating the project can be found in a text file in the repository
